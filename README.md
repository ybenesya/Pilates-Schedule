## Background
Recently I started my Pilates trainings in a local gym. Every week my trainer had to create manully the schedule for the next week and send it via WhatsApp to all her trainees. Then I had to pick a date and ask her to sign me up. I coulnd't know how many places left in that day, and it was tricky if I wanted to sign up with a friend. I decided to design and develop a management application that siplifies this training managemant and also provides transparancy for the trainees.

It was super exciting to build something that solves a real problem.
